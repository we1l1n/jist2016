Corrections:

In section 3.1 (c), there are a few mistakes about the definition of $A_{ij}$.

Actually I find out that $A_{ij} = A_{ji}$ does not apply to all circumstances.

Now I give the new definition of $A_{ij}$ as

![Aij](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yanshengjia/photo/master/Aij.png)

where $SR_{em}(i)$ is the *mention-entity semantic relatedness* between an entity node *i* and its only adjacent mention node.
