Corrections:

In section 3.1 (c), there are a few mistakes about the definition of *Aij*.

Actually I find out that *Aij = Aji* does not apply to all circumstances.

Now I give the new definition of *Aij* as

![Aij](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yanshengjia/photo/master/Aij.png)

where *SRem(i)* is the *mention-entity semantic relatedness* between an entity node *i* and its only adjacent mention node.
